## Process
* Started by dividing the project between us, Rameez took over the backend and Florencia was involved with the frontend mainly. 

* Constant communication was key, and throughout the building of this project we kept communicating to help each other and held several calls throughout the day to ensure we were both informed of what the other one was doing at all times.

* We made use of `Express` and `Nodemon` for the backend, and built the Frontend with `HTML` and pure `CSS`. We didn't use CSS frameworks for this.
